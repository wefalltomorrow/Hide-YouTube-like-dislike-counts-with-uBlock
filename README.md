# Hide-YouTube-like-dislike-counts-with-uBlock
A uBlock Origin/Nano Defender/Adblock Plus list to hide the like and dislike counts on YouTube whilst still keeping the buttons, as well hiding the like/dislike ratio bar underneath the buttons. I made this as an alternative the "Hide Youtube Likes/Dislikes" Chrome extension which was sadly taken down.
